A refactor-enabling tool for go, in go.

This won't rewrite your files (yet). Since I write in Vim, I'd like to have a
more modular tool which will tell me where to change what. Then I can pipe this
through another tool (ed, awk, Vim, whatever).

We're starting with Rename Symbol. Hopefully, we'll have ExtractVariable and
ExtractMethod soon thereafter. Then IntroduceParameter, and ChangeSignature.

That's probably 95% of what I use on a regular basis.
